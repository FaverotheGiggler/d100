# d100 Framework



## Chapter 1 â€“ Framework vs System



The focus of the d100 Framework is to build a skeleton of rules for a table top role playing game that fit in with a generous amount of playing styles and campaign environments. The d100 Framework is similar to a tabletop role playing game (RPG) in that it uses a skill based system as a framework for describing characters and their actions in a fictional setting.   

When attempting to simulate reality through a table top role playing game, any veteran player will realize that text based rules have limitations on their ability to describe the characters and their interaction with the environment.  Furthermore any rule set complex enough to hold players interests will inject a certain amount of min/maxing and game breaking rules or combination of abilities, advantages or powers.  As more "crunch" is introduced to a system, the more likely an imbalance of power will result.  The d100 framework is built with this in mind.

The d100 Framework presents rules on determining the outcome and effects of the characters actions in a fictional setting, not the description of the outcome and effects.  The description is left up to the players and Game Master (GM) to collaborate on and create their own unique play style and environment.  

As with any role playing game, a great amount of rules and mathematics may be involved initially, however once a character is built, maintenance and advancing a character is a fairly simple task, yet complex enough to hold a player's long term interest.  

Game Master's can create allies and antagonist's with unique specialties and powers, while creating an ever expanding list of allies, nemesis and foes for the players to interact with.

The d100 Framework attempts to engage players of both the role playing aspects of an RPG and the power gamer who thrives in simulated combat.  The theme to the d100 Framework is to hold both the mundane and epic within the same rule set, allowing even the lowliest of humans, a small chance at great or even epic success.  Much room in the d100 Framework is dedicated to combat, while seemingly avoiding concrete rules on the role playing situations.  This is intentional and a virtue of the system.  Using this type of framework allows power gamers to power game, role players to be role play.  

The experience system in the d100 Framework is organic.  Characters are encouraged to interact with other characters and the environment via skill rolls to achieve advancement.  The more times a character rolls a d100, the more likely they are to advance in a skill and gain experience.  This encourages participation of the players and allows the GM to reward players with character progress outside of combat experience point based system.

In addition to character customization, the d100 framework includes systems for crafting enhanced equipment, creating unique powers and gathering allies.  While the rules for these enhancements are provided, they are intentionally left vague, to allow the GM and players to integrate these type of features into the game, without the burden of specifics.

The combat system in the d100 Framework can be chaotic and deadly.  The essence of the combat system intends to be a good balance between real world simulation, fantasy cannon and comic book heroics.  

By intentionally removing descriptions of skills, powers, equipment and various other rule systems, the d100 Framework allows the player's to fill in the descriptive blanks.  This is the essence of the system.  Two different character may have the "wings" advantage and thus be able to fly.  However the method for flight will be left up to the player or GM to decide.  One player may describe his flight power or equipment as a pair of attached bat wings, while another may describe it as part of their Cyborg's rocket pack.  The effect of the flight power is the same, though the description of it will vary.



### What is Needed?

Like many other tabletop rpg's the d100 framework is built upon having a game master (GM) who acts as the storyteller for the players.  The GM presents the world and scenarios in which the players use a character to interact with the story.  When the rules refer to a character, this can be a character made by the GM, the player, or an ally the player has created.

The GM and players will need a set of the rules, pencils, and a set of dice to use the d100 framework.  The system uses two d10's to roll a d100, and depending on weapons and powers, a d8, d6, and a d4.  It is also highly suggested that the GM provide a grid and miniatures for the players to use during combat scenarios.



### Where are we?

In creating the d100 framework much thought was given to the system's ability to blend and mix typical role playing settings.  This allows a GM to create a campaign in established settings, or create new ones in which the characters exist.   The GM (or all players in a more democratic role playing group) will decide on a setting in which their characters will act.  In a fantasy setting the GM and players can ignore any equipment, rules, powers, rituals, or advantages that don't fit.  Laid out in the sections below are rules that govern fantasy settings, a supernatural World War II setting and occasionally it will dip into the worlds of the far-future.



### Who are we?

Characters are essential to any good story.  The d100 framework is focused on allowing a player to create a unique character.  This uniqueness is derived from the complexity of building a character.  There is no character classes in d100 framework.  The choice of race, stats, skills, advantages, powers, rituals, power pools, and equipment all play important roles in defining a character.  

Players familiar with online gaming will not find a quick path to classic character roles such as healer, striker, support or tank.  However these roles can all be created using the system, without locking a player into it's singular focus.
